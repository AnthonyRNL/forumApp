# forumApp
Hey guys,
So the object of this project is to create a forum. In muddling about, I thought a forum would be a great collaborative tool.
There are many times when we feel alone and feel like we need a community to discuss tough topics. One of these topics
is the perfect response to insults. The times when you feel like, "shit, that was the perfect comeback"...but that was 4 years later, we can empower the community to collectively form the perfect comeback. It won't be immediate, but it will help hone a skill, whether it's helping out a fellow bruised heart, or using other's sharp tongues as your sword.

Here's the Comeback

user stories
login *with password save to local storage will do in ruby
if can't login create new user
upon login they can create tread, go to thread, read it  and comment on it
able to edit any thread
like anything

only delete your own thread, maybes?
